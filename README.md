# facerec-service
A simple face recognition web service in Python

This Python script produces a REST API in Flask to expose a face recognition web service.
The script uses https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition in the background, so this should be installed first.

### installation instructions
* install **cmake** (required for *face_recognition* library): `sudo apt install cmake` 
* install python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
